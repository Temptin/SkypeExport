								chatmsg_status:2=outgoing, 4=incoming
							* my guess is we should rely on type:68 and just ignore chatmsg_type for file transfers. chatmsg_status still shows the actual direction of the transfer.
							* use guid to look up the transfer details
						type:30=call start (same _type and _status as 39)
						type:39=call end
							chatmsg_type:18 (always)
								chatmsg_status:2=outgoing, 4=incoming (NOTE: ONLY USABLE FOR CALL START; call_end events haven't got the proper direction status to show who really ended the call and should NOT be used for that)
							* the call_start event happens either A) when they pick up, or B) when the program gives up trying to call them (assumes they're not going to answer, which takes 2 minutes of trying (in Skype 5 as of now, may change later))
							* the call_end happens at exactly exactly the same timestamp as call_start when they declined/didn't pick up (I have never seen it differ even 1 second), otherwise the timestamp difference compared to call_start will be the call duration
							* use call_guid to identify each call. WARNING: call_guid is null for VERY OLD calls performed in Skype versions older than 5.
							* more data can be found in the Calls database, but it's nothing we can't determine from just these 2 events. that db has stuff like whether they MISSED the call by not responding for 2 minutes, and any microphone problems etc. useless info.
							* Skype's OWN history viewer does the same thing; it shows the start and end events at the exact same point in time in case it was declined/no pickup. we can even improve that, by just saying "call declined". sadly we have no way to look up the time that the call attempt was REALLY STARTED. that data DOES seem to be available in the Calls database, which contains a begin_timestamp that seems to show the time you BEGAN the call attempt. sadly, that database lacks a call_guid column so it's very difficult to correlate the data with the start/end events. I am guessing that is why even Skype's coders opted to ignore the data in the Calls db and just show start/end at the exact same time for missed/declined calls. the Calls db contains NOTHING to correlate with the Messages db, and it doesn't even contain info about the participant; it contains a binary field with the BINARY GUIDs of the people in the call. the only good thing about it is that it has a conv_dbid column that correlates to the conversation ID, which seems to be a constant ID for each partner pairing, so the ONLY thing you could do is to look at the conversation ID while scanning Messages, and when you see a new ID you read in all call data for that conversation ID, and then you begin parsing messages. you must then look at the previous AND current Message timestamp to determine if you should throw in a "call attempt started" message line there. it's all too much work and too slow, and I bet that is why Skype themselves don't do it.
						type:10=person added to group conference; if you were the one that created the conference then the dialog_partner will be the person you were chatting with when you pressed the "add to conference" button, and the convo_id will be the conference ID. if someone ELSE adds you, the convo_id is 0 (except possibly re-used IDs on re-used conferences) and dialog_partner is null. "participant_count" is the number of people in the conference (this number will keep rising as more people are added, and lowering as people leave). when you first join a conference CREATED BY SOMEONE ELSE, an event type "100" is also fired, with an identities field like "coolguy123 otherguy123 grince.farbgold", in other words a space-separated list of all current participants (any people that you don't have on your contact list is added to your Contacts database, with is_permanent=0 to signal that you have not added them to your permanent contacts, but that their data is available for use i.e. getting their displaynames). after that, it's up to you to keep track of joins/leaves/participant counts via events types 13 and 10.
							chatmsg_type:1 (always, apparently)
								chatmsg_status:as usual this means the direction (incoming/outgoing) of the event
									* parsing strategy: parse history for dialog_partner, and at the first sign of type:10 you grab the new convo_id and store it in an array as "conferences started by us", then look up the associated displayname (in the Conversations database) for that conference, and output a chat link saying "from_dispname (our name) started a conference: name of conference". later, after you have parsed the log, you grab any missing conference ids and then finally loop through your "convo_id" (conference) arrays and output those too at the end of the document, with appropriate "<div id=conf_74327>" tags to allow the above conference links to work.
									* also note: the initial event that started the conference is ONLY logged for the person you were chatting with at the time and ONLY IF *YOU* CREATED THE CONFERENCE, NOT for any of the people that were added to the conference, and NOT if THEY invited YOU, so you will not see conference links for those people when viewing their logs; you only ever see links when YOU created the conference, and ONLY for the one person you were chatting with at the time you pressed the "+add people" button.
									* we will not be parsing event 100 (the "people in the conference" sync event), because we don't care who is already in the conference.
									* the "identities" field for event type 10 is USUALLY *one* name because of how people use it (when YOU *and other people* become invited to a conference, meaning when some third party selects you and a bunch of others ot make a conference, then you will get a type 10 with JUST your name in it, and a type 100 with the other names. also, when someone adds JUST ONE person to the conference, you get 1 identity. the trouble happens when someone adds 2+ people after the conference started, OR when *YOU* start the conference with multiple people selected. in those cases, the identities field will have as many space-separated SkypeIDs as needed.
						type:13=person left the conference.
							chatmsg_type:4 (always, apparently)
								chatmsg_status:as usual this means the direction (incoming/outgoing) of the event; if it is incoming then someone else left, and if it is outgoing then you left.
									* this one is really easy to handle, just use the author/from_dispname to show the person that left for incoming, or write "you left" for outgoing. unlike type 10, "identities" is not used at all here, thankfully.
									* this event only occurs inside conference convo_id streams, so no need to check the isConference flag.
					* note: outgoing means from YOU to the partner --->, and incoming means from the PARTNER to you <---
					
					author (text): the SkypeID of the person that wrote the message (such as andy.norin). will NEVER be null.
					
					from_dispname (text): the active displayname of the person that wrote the message (such as Anders Norin). will NEVER be null.
					
					body_xml (text): the text that was written. it's fully xml-compliant, so stuff like apostrophes are &apos; (well, there IS a flag called body_is_rawxml which is either 1 or null, but I had a look and the only time it has been null is the times when body_xml has been either empty or null itself, so we can safely assume that body_xml is ALWAYS encoded as safe xml)
					
					timestamp (integer): the unix timestamp of when the message was first sent (not when it was delivered, which may come later)
					
					edited_timestamp (integer): null most of the time, but when it contains a value it gives the time of the last edit to the message
					
					dialog_partner (text): the name of the person you are chatting with in single-person chats. always has the same value even when THEY send YOU a message. example: "andy.norin". this value is null in multiperson chats (conferences), apart from the very first message in a conference where it seems to denote the person you were chatting with when the conference was created.
					
					guid (blob): this is a globally unique identifier for the message. we only need it when parsing filetransfer data, as the filetransfer information is stored under this guid.
					
					call_guid (text): this is the call globally unique identifier, used for identifying individual calls' start and end events. only contains any data for event types 30+39. WARNING: call_guid is null for VERY OLD calls performed in Skype versions older than 5.
					
					convo_id (integer): this is the unique identifier for your dialog partner combination; it is permanent (the same whenever you talk to the same partner). also, whenever you create a conference chat (more than 2 people), it generates a new convo_id. The "conversations" database contains mappings for id -> partner's "identity" (skypeID) and other info. we'll mainly be using convo_id to correlate calls in the Calls database. LONG NOTE: However, you should NOT use convo_id to "locate all events between you and that person"; use dialog_partner for that, because otherwise you will be lacking some events, primarily (or only? it is the only missing one I have observed) event type 10 aka the creation of a new group conference chat (by inviting more chat partners), as that event will still have a dialog_partner that's the same as the person you were chatting with, but the convo_id will be new (the new convo id for that new group conference, to be precise) - note that this is useful info if you want to parse group convos too, simply store all eventtype 10 convo ids and then parse those too; the first event of a group conference has the dialog_partner you were with when the group conference was started, and the remaining ones have a null value for dialog_partner.
					
					identities (text): this is NULL for EVERY event type EXCEPT a handful. when it's NOT null, it is a space-separated list of one or more skypeIDs of the people that are taking part of that event. here are the eventtypes where it is used: 110 (unknown event). 100: conference sync event (contains list of existing conference participants, seems to only be sent out when you are added to someone else's conference). 51 (unknown event, almost 100% sure it is for accepted friend request). 50 (friend request; status 2/4 indicates direction). 39 (call start, contains list of people called; one in 1on1, one or more in conference). 30 (call end; value similar to call start, except it may possibly contain early dropouts as single identities entries, until finally everyone has dropped out; OR perhaps it just indicates when YOU hung up and the people that were also in that call, even people that dropped out earlier? FIXME: test that? or not give a shit? I prefer NOT GIVE A SHIT!). 10 (conference join event; identities contains the list of people that were added, usually just one but will be several if more than one person is added at a time). oddly enough event 13 (conference leave event) does NOT use identities, instead the "author"/"from_dispname" is the person that left (which can be yourself, just use chatmsg_status to judge direction to see if it was you that left)

									/*
										filename (text): the plain name of the file, such as "the.phantom.menace.1080p.mkv"
										
										filesize (text, even though you would expect integer, but I guess they did this to avoid having too-small integers to hold the data in-memory?, luckily we can query it as int to have SQLite cast it for us): the size of the file in bytes, such as "2444978"
										
										filepath (text): the full path to where we saved the file (if receiving) or where it came from (if sending). this contains stuff like "/Volumes/Secondary OS/path/to/file.jpg". it is null if it was an incoming transfer that WE never accepted (either because they cancelled it or because we cancelled it), since Skype has no idea where it WOULD have been saved if we'd have accepted. we'll ONLY use this value during SENDING, and only when that's done TO CONFERENCES. when that's the case, we will use it to avoid counting the same file multiple times for each participant. (we will NEVER use this value for receiving, since receiving files in a conference only inserts ONE entry per file in the Transfers database, we don't know the state of hte others in the conference and don't need to bother with that; as for outgoing transfers to 1on1 chats, we likewise only have 1 entry per file since there's only 1 recipient; we ONLY need it for OUTGOING TO CONFERENCE). note: I wish we could have just used the participant_count column in the Messages table, as that would have been such a clean solution, but sadly that value is null for pre-Skype 5 events...
										
										partner_dispname (text): the displayname of your chat partner. for 1on1 chats, this is always the person you're talking to no matter the direction of the filetransfer. for OUTGOING transfers to conferences, it's one of the recipients (conferences have MULTIPLE rows for the same file, each with a different partner, to differentiate the transfer states for each person; there's also partner_handle for their SkypeID if that is more desirable). for INCOMING transfers from someone in a conference, it's seems to be the name of the sender, but that doesn't matter for us since we already have a reliable sender name via the "from_dispname" row. THE *ONLY* THING WE WILL BE USING PARTNER_DISPNAME FOR IS TO DIFFERENTIATE THE RECEIVING STATE PER-PERSON *OF OUR OUTGOING TRANSFERS TO THE CONFERENCE*.
										
										status (integer): shows the current state of the file, such as transfer completed, or "waiting", etc. known values:
											0 = no action taken
											2 = you are sending a file to someone, they have not accepted yet (this will happen if you send while they are offline or you log out before they accept it, or if you export the database while skype is running and they haven't accepted yet)
											7 = recipient (you/they) cancelled
											8 = recipient (you/they) completed transfer
											9 = ? FIXME: might mean transfer failed due to connection problem. insufficient data to determine what this means.
											10 = skype is currently open. they are trying to send you a file, you have not accepted yet. turns into 0 if you close skype without accepting it.
											12 = you are sending a file to someone, THEY hit cancel. strange, what's different from 7?
											* There are way too many weird codes. I'll simply go 8 = Completed, Everything Else = Not transferred.
										
										note: we COULD also print the "filepath" field, which is a string value showing the source/destination path on OUR disk. this contains stuff like "/Volumes/Secondary OS/path/to/file.jpg"... kinda nice to have but then again the surrounding discussion reveals what the subject was and lets you determine what the files were about, and also by the time you've made the log the files have probably been either moved or deleted in most cases. finally, printing such info would clutter the log files, and storing it as <a href="file://path"> would be nonsensical as A) most paths would be broken and B) the paths could contain sensitive info and leak such info if you share the log with someone.
